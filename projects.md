<h3>Magic Manuscript Maker Typesetting Software</h3>
<p class="project-teaser">
	The <em>Magic Manuscript Maker</em> is a collection of open-source tools and scripts that help to automate the typesetting process of academic articles. The workflow is designed to be used in a Docker container and currently used by the Philosophy and the Mind Sciences journal. The individual tools are channeled through a web application called the "Magic Manuscript Maker", which allows to create user profiles and projects. However, the individual tools can also be used independently.
