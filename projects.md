### Description
The *Religious Studies Annotation Project for Machine Learning* has set itself the task of annotating short text sequences, which currently consist primarily of Twitter data, by as many (anonymous) people as possible. The annotated data should later be applied for machine learning or other purposes. Currently, the focus of annotation is on the question of whether a text is to be classified as “religious” or “non-religious”. Since it is not always possible to classify a text unambiguously, it is important that as many people as possible take part in the annotation process in order to obtain an average value.

The *Religious Studies Annotation Project for Machine Learning* is a Python web application created with [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).

#### Corpora

At this point, four different text corpora are available. The first corpus contains tweets that include semantics of holiness (e.g. holy, sacred, holiness). The second corpus includes tweets that explicitly refer to religion (e.g. religion, religious). The third corpus contains tweets that mention words with a ritual reference (e.g. ritual, cult). The fourth corpus includes tweets with words related to purity (e.g. purity, pure). The corpora are constantly being expanded and updated. The current size of the corpora can be viewed under the menu item “Corpus Selection”. It is important to note that I have not cleaned the Twitter data. This means that there might be tweets that only consist of one single link or a smilie.

In the future, other text corpora will also be made available for annotation, provided that they are related to the study of religion. Suggestions for corpora can be sent to thomas.jurczyk-q88@rub.de. It is important that there are no legal problems with the provision of corpora.

The annotated corpora should be made freely available at regular intervals and with their current status, so that everyone can use them for their own projects. The names of the respective users who have annotated the corpora will be made anonymous in the downloadable version.
