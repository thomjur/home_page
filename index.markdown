My name is Thomas Jurczyk. I am a historian and scholar in the field of religious studies at the [Ruhr-University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en). I defended my PhD thesis in September 2020. I am currently working as a research assistant and managing editor of [Entangled Religions](https://er.ceres.rub.de/) at the ["Center for Religious Studies" (CERES)](https://ceres.rub.de/en/) at the Ruhr-University Bochum. I am teaching B.A. courses on Greco-Roman religions and digital methods in the study of religion. My special interest are the history of ancient religions and the application of digital methods and quantitative approaches in the study of religion.

Other research interests are:

- Early Christianity
- History of religious notions
- Iconoclasm
- Python/Java programming

This website contains selected information about me and my projects. It also includes a list of my publications and presentations.
