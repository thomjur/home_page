I am a historian and scholar in the field of religious studies at the [Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en). Currently, I am working as a research assistant and managing editor of [Entangled Religions](https://er.ceres.rub.de/) at the [Center for Religious Studies (CERES)](https://ceres.rub.de/en/).

As part of our teaching unit, I am mainly teaching BA/MA classes on Greco-Roman religions and digital methods. My research interests are the history of ancient religions, an/iconism, and the application of digital methods and quantitative approaches in the study of religion.

This website contains selected information about me and my projects. It also includes an overview of my publications and presentations.
