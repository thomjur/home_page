	I am a historian, computer scientist, and scholar in the field of religious studies currently based at the <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en" style="font-family: monospace">Ruhr-Universität Bochum</a>.

<p class="title-text">	
	In Bochum, I am working as a research software engineer at the SFB 1475 <a href="https://sfb1475.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/research/outline/" style="font-family: monospace">Metaphors of Religion</a>. I also have experience developing automated workflows for online journals, such as the <a href="https://github.com/phimisci" style="font-family: monospace"> Magic Manuscript Maker</a>, and I used to teach Python and data science related classes at the University of Tübingen.

	My professional work sits at the intersection of software engineering and digital humanities. I collaborate with humanities projects to develop project-specific software solutions, perform and support data analysis, manage and maintain databases, and provide overall tech support. Another important area of my interest is the development of single-source publishing workflows and corresponding software tools for online academic journals and scholars.
