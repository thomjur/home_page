My name is Thomas Jurczyk. I am a historian and scholar in the field of religious studies at the [Ruhr-University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en). I submitted my thesis in March 2020. I am currently working as a research assistant at the ["Center for Religious Studies" (CERES)](https://ceres.rub.de/en/) at the Ruhr-University Bochum. I am teaching B.A. courses on Greco-Roman religions and digital methods in the study of religion. My special interest lies in the application of digital methods and quantitative approaches in the study of religion.

My major research interests are:

- Greco-Roman religions
- Early Christianity
- History of religious notions
- digital methods in the humanities
- Iconoclasm
- Python proogramming

This website contains selected information about me and my projects. It also includes a list of my publications and presentations.
